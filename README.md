# something
Hopefully a game at some point built with some of the other DE folks.

## Tags and Branches
I've tagged each chapter in the official rust book with the resulting code from
said chapter. The master branch holds the code for each of those chapters,
while the piston branch is the result of my learning Piston.

# Rust
Just finished the second chapter in the official Rust documentation

## Pros
- pattern matching
- immutability by default
- cargo (think pip with automatic requirements.txt and git integration)
- static types with type inference
- lightweight syntax compared to c# and java
- sane semantics

## cons
- the extern syntax + use feels redundant so far; I suspect that it's used for
  polymorphism
- encouraged shadowing of variables, though that's probably OK for variables
  explicitly made mutable
- heavy syntax compared to Haskell

## neutral
- macros
- brackets + semicolons vs indentation/layout based syntax
