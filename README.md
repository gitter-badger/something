Hopefully a game at some point built with some of the other DE folks

# Current Progress
At the moment, we have been researching languages. The current contenders are:
  - [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)
  - [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/)

# Examples
- `guess`: Implements a number guessing game
- `dining_philosophers`: implements the dining philosophers problem, which
   demonstrates concurrency
