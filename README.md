# something
Hopefully a game at some point built with some of the other DE folks

# Rust
Just finished the second chapter in the official Rust documentation

## Pros
- pattern matching
- immutability by default
- cargo (think pip with automatic requirements.txt and git integration)
- static types with type inference
- lightweight syntax compared to c# and java
- sane semantics

## cons
- the extern syntax + use feels redundant so far; I suspect that it's used for
  polymorphism
- encouraged shadowing of variables, though that's probably OK for variables
  explicitly made mutable
- heavy syntax compared to Haskell

## neutral
- macros
- brackets + semicolons vs indentation/layout based syntax
